This component allows integration of the waardepapieren-frontend wizard into other websites.

The way to do this is:

1. Include the `.css` and `.js` files in the built folder into your website.
2. Set `window.waardepapierenConfigUrl` to the url that needs to be fetched to obtain the configuration.
3. For a configuration sample, [see here](https://github.com/discipl/waardepapieren/blob/master/haarlem-frontend/public/clerk-frontend-config.json)
